/* COMMAND FORMAT (IN ASCII)
 * NOTE: MAXIMUM LENGTH OF 20 characters.
 * <flag><speed><SEP><angle><SEP><val><END>
 *
 * <flag>: 1 char
 * - use one of the characters below to specify which action to take.
 *
 * ----------- FOR DRIVE COMMANDS ONLY ------------
 * <speed>: 1-3 chars
 * - specify speed to drive, from 0 to 100 (integer).
 *
 * <angle>: 1+ chars, in degrees
 * - specify angle to steer, from -25 to 25 (float).
 * - negative angle: steer left, positive angle: steer right.
 *
 *
 * <val>: 1+ chars, in cm
 * - specify distance to drive, from 0 to 500 (float).
 * - (ONLY FOR DIST_TARGET commands) when <angle> != 0:
 * 		specify turn angle to complete, from 0 to 360 (float).
 * ----------- FOR DRIVE COMMANDS ONLY ------------
 *
 * <SEP>: character specified below as CMD_SEP ('|').
 * <END>: character specified below as CMD_END ('\n').
 *
 * e.g., to drive forward at speed 50 for 30cm going straight:
 * send 'T50|0|30\n'
 *
 * e.g., to drive backward at speed 20 until 5cm away while wheels are steering left 10 degrees:
 * send 'w20|-10|5\n'
 *
 * For return messages, the robot will send back the following:
 * <INDICATOR><CMD_STR>
 *
 * <CMD_STR>: original command string sent (including end char)
 *
 * <INDICATOR>:
 * - CMD_RCV (specified below as 'r'): command has been received
 * - CMD_FIN (specified below as 'f'): command has been finished
